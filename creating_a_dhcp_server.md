# Creating a DHCP Server #

So... I was all ok with following the guide until I went to [install SpaceWalk][install-spacewalk] and saw it required Java. I nope'd my way out of there as quickly as possible...

It's not that I'm particularly against Java. I mean, I'm a WinForms developer by day....

It's just that I don't really like using technology I don't understand and Java is pretty high up there on the "Black Box and Rat's Nest Configuration" scale. I mean, sure, I could learn everything I need to about it but doing that once with .NET I think gives me enough exposure to "enterprise" technologies for a lifetime...
